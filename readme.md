## About

This is a repo of completed projects from the [Codecademy.com Full-Stack Engineer courses](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/full-stack-engineer-career-path).


These projects all had an intro paragraph and then a step-by-step set of instructions. I've included the intro paragraphs with each file here, but the step-by-steps were too long.

## Included files

- 4 - JavaScript Syntax, Part 1
  - Kelvin Weather - Teaches comments, variables, math operations, and string interpolation.
  - Dog Years - Teaches variables, string functions, math operations, and string interpolation.
  - Magic Eight Ball - Teaches conditionals, if/else, ternary expressions, switch/case statements, and random numbers
  - Race Day - Teaches conditionals, if/else, and string interpolation.
